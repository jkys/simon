The SIMON source code requires the masm32 library as well as an edited version of the Irvine 32 library.
To install follow these steps:
1.) Install the masm32 using the "masm32 library install" executible
2.) Follow the steps to install masm32.
3.) Once done navigate to "C:\masm32\include" and move the Irvine32_NOWIN.inc file into the folder.
4.) You now have all the files needed to run the source code.

This was an assembly project written in x86 assembly using the Irvine 32 library. This project was created by a team of three members (Maya Bloom, Chris Potter, Jonathan Keys), who all shared different responsibilities of the project.

This project is a recreation of the game "Simon" a game which tests your memory by having you repeat the pattern which is given to you as it increments it's length by one,, each succesful pass.
